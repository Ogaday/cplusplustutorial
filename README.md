README - CPLUSPLUS.COM TUTORIAL FILES
=====================================

This is my sandbox to play with C++ in as I go through the cplusplus.com tutorial. I've spent most of my programming hours on Python and I believe there are complexities in C++ that simply do not arise in Python. Therefore, I want to give myself a fair shake at getting good at C++ because it is so essential. Hence, I start here, at the beginning.

Apparently, all of the code snippets in the tutorial are console programs, so I will likely try to write my code in a rext editor such as notepad++ and compile the code on the command line. I have the anaconda distribution, which I believe comes with the C++ compilers I have in my path.
